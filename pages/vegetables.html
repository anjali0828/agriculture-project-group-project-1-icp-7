        <p class="various_produts_info"> <b>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is
            still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the
            flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat
            arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that
            are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes,
            flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.</b></p>
