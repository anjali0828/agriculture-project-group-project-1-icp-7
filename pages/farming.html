            economy. Farmers rely heavily on their tools and equipment to enhance productivity and yield a successful
            harvest. Having the right farming tools can make all the difference in the world, from plowing and
            irrigation to harvesting and post-harvest processing. In this article, we will explore the different types
            of farming tools in India and their role in agriculture. Weâ€™ll also cover traditional and modern techniques
            for sustainable farming, as well as how to choose the right tools for your specific needs.</b></p>
